# Monika R-Level 2 Report 
## TASK 1: Working of a Version Control
Version Control helps us have a track of all the changes we make and also to keep them saved in the memory.This proves itself as an advantage over normal file management.It helped me understand how we can use GitHub for trackibg and making use of Git commands, such as git branch, git merge, git revert and git cherry-pick that could help us perform actions such as commit, branch, merge and etc.
This helped me gain insight of how to use Git Bash for making changes to a repository and how to hold track of all the changes the repository has gone through over the time.

## TASK 2: IP Addressing and Web Scraping - Job Listings Scraper
Web Scraping is a technique that helps in process of extracting data or content from websites using various libraries of python.Through this task I was able to understand about how to scrape a website for information and save it. It was useful in understanding dynamic web scraping.
Using various libraries of python such as Selenium, chromedriver and other libraries, it was possible to scrape a webpage that provides information of job list that includes title of the position, job description, location of company and the website link to the same. These were saved to a csv file.
